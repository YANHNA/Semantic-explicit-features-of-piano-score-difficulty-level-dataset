# Semantic-explicit-features-of-piano-score-difficulty-level-dataset

The piano score difficulty measurement problem is evaluated on two datasets named 8notes (EN) and ambrosepianotabs (AMBPT), which are collected from the website 8notes[1] and pianotabs[2].
The two datasets are constructed according to the five criteria by Serra[3].

This provides the semantic-explicit-features of the EN and AMBPT datasets.
1) The EN dataset consists of 677 music pieces assigned to 4 difficulty levels: beginners, easy, intermediate, and advanced. 
All scores of the EN dataset are collected according to the tags of the difficulty level and piano solo, from which the MIDI files are free to download. 

2) The AMBPT dataset consists of 9 difficulty levels with a total number of 2040 music pieces.


All the files included are as follows:
1.'EN_old_features.mat':
2.'EN_new_features.mat':
3.'EN_total_features.mat':
4.'AMBPT_old_features.mat':
5.'AMBPT_new_features.mat':
6.'AMBPT_total_features.mat':
7.'feature_name_old.mat'
8.'feature_name_new.mat'
9.'feature_name_total.mat'
